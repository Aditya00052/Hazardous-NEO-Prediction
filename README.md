<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this project, the goal was to predict whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) poses a hazard to Earth by analyzing features such as velocity, diameter, and distance from Earth. The dataset, collected from NASA's satellites, contains over 300,000 records, providing extensive data for analysis. Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, SVC, SGD, and neural networks, were employed. The random forest classifier outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 95% and a ROC-AUC score of 99%.</p>


<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Space safety is a critical challenge in the modern era, with Near-Earth Objects representing potential threats. This project aimed to contribute by harnessing machine learning to identify hazardous NEOs efficiently. The idea of combining scientific data with predictive analytics inspired me to delve into this field. Moreover, the opportunity to work with cutting-edge models and achieve high classification accuracy added to the motivation.</p>


<h3>Steps for the project:</h3>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Data Collection</b>: Used NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset to gather features like velocity, diameter, and distance.</li>
  <li><b>Feature Engineering</b>: Processed and refined the dataset for model input.</li>
  <li><b>Model Selection</b>: Applied various modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, SGD, and Neural Networks.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluation</b>: Compared models based on accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.</li>
  <li><b>Finalization</b>: Selected Random Forest as the optimal model for this task.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Final Result</h3>
<p>The random forest classifier emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 95% and a ROC-AUC score of 99%, demonstrating its reliability in classifying hazardous and non-hazardous NEOs.</p>
