# Hazardous-NEO-Prediction
This project aimed to predict whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) poses a hazard to Earth by analyzing features such as velocity, diameter, and distance. Various models, including logistic regression, random forest, SVC, SGD, and neural networks, were tested. The random forest classifier emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 95%.
